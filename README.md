The code is divided into different functions and each functions has a particular task. The phase 1 of our project is just focused on rice. As a first step we take the readings from the user or use their location to get vital information like temperature and soil type, the sensor will provide information like moisture content of the soil. On the basis of these three factors (i.e temperature, soil type and moisture content in the soil) the program will find the pests that is most likely attack the crop (using bubble sort method) under those conditions, and will suggest the suitable pesticide.
THE ALGORITHM EXPLAINED IN THECODE IS THE BASE WHICH WILL BE USED TO CREATE THE CHATBOT ASSISTANT THAT WILL INTERACT WITH THE FARMER AND ASSIST IN HIS WORK.THE CODING DONE IS FOR A SAMPLE CROP THAT IS RICE AND ONE STATE( i.e) TAMIL NADU IS CONSIDERED AND THE IDEA HAS BEEN IMPLEMEMTED.WE HAVE SPLIT OUR SILUTION INTO THREE PHASES AND THIS ALGORITHM FALLS UNDER PHASE 1 .PHASE 2 AND PHASE 3 WILL CREATE THE FULL BODY OF OUR SOUTION AND WILL LEAD TO OUR FINAL PRODUCT.THE DATABASE THAT HAS BEEN CRETAED CONSISTS OF DUMMY VALUES AND THE IDEA HAS BEEN CARRIED FORWORD.
